[Ctypes][7] is a wonderful way to get your python program to harness the functionality of existing shared libraries. I am using it to write mathematical solvers in C and write wrappers around them in Python. You can download (boilerplate) [code][10] that I wrote while getting ctypes to work as I would like. 

Articles I referred to when I was putting things together are referenced below.

1. [stackoverflow: How do I convert a Python list into C array using ctypes?][1]
2. [redstack: x86 Calling conventions][2]
3. [Nynaeve: Win32 Calling conventions][3]
4. [TLDP: Program Library HOWTO - Shared Libraries][4]
5. [stackoverflow: python ctypes failed when importing a dll file][5]
6. [stackoverflow: How to return array from C++ function to Python using ctypes][6]
7. [Python Doc: ctypes - A foreign function library for Python][7]
8. [SageMath: Ctypes][8]
9. [SciPy: Cookbook/Ctypes][9]

Comments on the links above:

1. I attempted to load the dll using cdll.LoadLibrary(). And when it did not work,  after looking at /usr/lib/python2.7/ctypes/util.py 
which uses a pretty neat trick to locate the library (original snippet included with zipfile) I tried setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH from python before trying to load my library but to no avail. I was beginning to lose patience and give up in getting the whole thing working until I tried [CDLL][5]()
2. The last [answer][6] (by Hui Zheng) was very useful in clearing my doubts of how to return an array from C and get it garbage collected in python.

I wish I had more time to do further research and write a detailed (error free, not sure that there exists any in this one) article on ctypes. I'll probably get around and do it if I use it regularly and become adept at it.
