I am a PhD student in the department of computer science at `Virginia Tech`. I work on numerical algorithms - specifically for time integration of differential equations.

I am broadly interested in simulation, algorithms and mathematics. Earlier, I obtained my MS in operations research from `Virginia Tech` and worked with `Optym, LLC` as a Systems Engineer where I enjoyed solving transporation/logistical network problems using simulation-optimization techniques.
